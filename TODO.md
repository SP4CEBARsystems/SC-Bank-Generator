1. single ROM line bank circuits
2. SVG scaling
3. label the shown circuit: input output wires, memory banks with a unique id code each, input segment location, 00-ff, digit
idea: make the circuit interactive so you can hover over a bank to copy it
3. safe eval()
4. launch and share
5. clear before regenerate to remove residue
V. copy buttons

note:
- the sfm will still have inputs and output wires shown above the loop connection
- an sfm may have unlooped outputs: side-ROMs
