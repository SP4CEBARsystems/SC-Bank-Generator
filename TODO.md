2. ROM array circuits shouldn't be merged into a single output wire
3. label the shown circuit: input output wires, memory banks with a unique id code each, input segment location, 00-ff, digit
idea: make the circuit interactive so you can hover over a bank to copy it
4. clear unused space in bank with 0 for clarity

V. single ROM line bank circuits
V. launch and share
V. safe eval()
V. clear before regenerate to remove residue
V. regenerate doesn't work, prevvious result isn't cleared
V. SVG scaling
V. copy buttons

note:
- the sfm will still have inputs and output wires shown above the loop connection
- an sfm may have unlooped outputs: side-ROMs
